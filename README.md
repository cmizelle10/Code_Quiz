# Code Quiz

## Description

In this project, I have built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student </br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores </br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz </br>
WHEN I click the start button </br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question </br>
WHEN I answer a question </br>
THEN I am presented with another question </br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly </br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock </br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 </br>
THEN the game is over </br>
WHEN the game is over </br>
THEN I can save my initials and score 

## Installation

The only thing needed for this project is an environment to write HTML, CSS and Javscript code such as VS code.

## Usage

When the page loads, click the "Start Quiz" button. You will then be asked a series of multiple-choice questions. There will be a timer in the top right corner of the page that will count down. If you get a question wrong, it will subtract 10 seconds. After you answer a question, it will move to the next question while also notifying you if you answered correctly or incorrectly. The quiz will end when either the timer is up or you have answered all questions.
